# Problem
Scenario:

You have a React app with a UserContext created using the context API.

There are two separate components, Home and User, each in different folders.

In your App component, you are wrapping each component with its own UserProvider, like this:

```
<App>
  <UserProvider>
    <Home />
  </UserProvider>

  <UserProvider>
    <User />
  </UserProvider>
</App>

```

# Question:

If you update a value provided by UserProvider inside the Home component, will that change also be reflected in the User component when it tries to access the same value from the context? If not, why?

# Solution

In the scenario you described, where you've wrapped each component (Home and User) in separate instances of UserProvider, changes made to the context in one component (Home) will not be reflected in the other component (User).

Here's why:

# Separate Context Instances:

Each time you wrap a component with <UserProvider>, you're creating a new instance of the context with its own independent state.
The Home component is working with one instance of the context, and the User component is working with another, completely separate instance.
Independent State:

Since each UserProvider creates its own context state, any changes made within the Home component will only affect the context state within that specific provider.
The User component, wrapped in its own UserProvider, will not be aware of or affected by changes in the Home component because it has its own independent context state.

## Visual Representation:

```<App>
<UserProvider> (Instance 1)
<Home> (Uses Instance 1's context state)
<UserProvider> (Instance 2)
<User> (Uses Instance 2's context state)
```

## Result:

Any state changes made within Home (Instance 1) will not affect User (Instance 2) because they are working with different context instances.
